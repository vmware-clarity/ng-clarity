// why are we doing these in groups?
// so that more explicit side declarations can override more general axis declarations
// it's more verbose but allows customization through greater specificity
// <div cds-layout="p:sm p-t:lg p-b:none">...</div>

// The micro syntax is primarily needed for performance.
// To support all the sides as well as breakpoints we need
// a compact syntax to prevent an excessive amount of generated CSS.
